The observation of cosine-like appearance of the principal mode projections
indicates that, as in the case of the Argon gas, the protein motion is
primarily diffusive. What does that mean? That most likely means that the 
protein is exploring a rather flat energy landscape, as a multidimensional
random walk, without observing any major barriers. This is a strong indication
that the trajectory has not converged, i.e. has not reached equilibrium. The 
"cosine content" can be obtained from "g_analyze -cc", yielding a powerful
convergence criterion. Note that the fact that a high cosine content in a
principal mode from a protein trajectory does not mean that the <it> direction
</it> corresponding to that mode is not meaningful, it just means that the
motion has not yet converged. Whether a <it> direction </it> is meaningful or
not can be analyzed by checking how similar the principal modes from one part
of the trajectory are to those obtained from another part. Such a comparison
can be carried out using the overlap measure activated by "g_anaeig -over".
